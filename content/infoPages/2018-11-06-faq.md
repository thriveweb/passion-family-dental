      Passion Family Dental North Lakes is proud to provide treatment using
      Medicare's Child Dental Benefit Schedule (CDBS) and are happy to bulk bill
      all services that are available through the schedule to children eligible
      under this scheme. The schedule has been developed by Medicare to provide
      dental services for children aged between 2 and 17 years. It enables
      eligible children to receive up to $1000 in dental services over a
      two-year period and covers a range of dental services including
      examinations, x-rays, cleaning, fissure sealing, fillings, root canal
      treatments and extractions. Orthodontic or cosmetic treatment is not
      covered by this scheme at this point in time. The CDBS has a means test,
      which requires receipt of Family Tax Benefit Part A or a relevant
      Australian Government payment. If you are unsure of your child’s
      eligibility, please give us a call on 3465 1199 and we will happily check
      for you.

      A crown is essentially a tooth shaped “cap” that is placed over the top of
      the tooth to restore its strength. The crown completely encases the entire
      visible portion of a tooth that lies at and above the gum line. This is a
      great option for teeth that have been weakened through decay, cracks or
      fillings. Crowns are also recommended to be placed after a tooth has
      received a root canal treatment to give additional protection and strength
      to the tooth. A crown protects your tooth in a similar way to motorcycle
      helmets protect our heads.

      Once we have welcomed you and made sure you are comfortable, we will guide
      you through completing a brief medical history form. Once you have moved
      on to the clinic, Dr Sam will conduct a new patient examination. This
      involves a thorough review of your teeth, gums, chewing muscles, and any
      lumps or bumps in your mouth. We will often take x-rays to discover any
      decay between your teeth, or old leaking fillings that may need
      replacement. We’ll also take photos with our intraoral camera, which we
      display to you on the chair-side monitor to let you see exactly what is
      going on inside your mouth. Dr Sam will also give you a thorough
      explanation of what’s happening with each tooth. At the end of your visit,
      we will give you a treatment plan of findings and pricing, so you will
      know exactly what your treatment costs are – no nasty surprises! You will
      have plenty of time to ask any questions you may have regarding any
      treatment options so that you are comfortable and confident in the
      treatment we will be providing. It is a very open and honest appointment
      and we promise not to push you into having treatment you don’t want or
      need.

Using our HICAPS facility we will be able to help you to claim back the cover immediately; just bring in your health fund card and leave the rest to us! All you need to do is pay the remaining balance. Nice and easy!\r\n\nWe are preferred provider for HCF. This means that patients with HCF membership under the HCF More For Teeth program, are able to get 100% back on (depending on your level of cover),  all preventative services such as one or two dental examinations per calendar year professional teeth cleaning, fluoride treatment, diagnostic X-rays and custom made sports mouth-guards."
    title: Which health funds do you accept?
  - text: "We tailor your dental appointment to your own personal needs, therefore we can’t predict what dental treatment you’ll need in advance. Instead, we’ll arrange an initial consultation for our dentist to meet you and your teeth. \r\r\n\nThe standard cost of a comprehensive examination, in which we review of your teeth, gums, chewing muscles, and any lumps or bumps in your mouth, take photos with our intraoral camera, which we then display to you on the chair-side monitor to let you see exactly what is going on inside your mouth, is $70. From this exam we can then provide you with a detailed costing of any of the treatments you will have discussed with Dr Sam. This price is before we process any health fund refunds so you may find your exam costs considerably less (depending on your level of insurance cover)."

      Yes we happily accept Medicare for children using the Children's Dental

      The Australian Dental Association recommends that to maintain good oral
      hygiene we need to visit the dentist every six months for an exam and
      clean. Having a regular dental exam with Passion Family Dental can help
      you guard against painful conditions and toothaches and potentially avoid
      expensive surprises. This way we can pick up problems early and stop decay
      from progressing.

      There are many options available to patients who have teeth crowding
      issues or concerns. At Passions Family Dental we are committed to ensuring
      our patients always receive the very best treatment and care; should you
      or your child require orthodontic treatment (braces) we are happy to refer
      you to a local qualified orthodontist who specializes in correcting teeth
      alignment.
    title: How easy is it to straighten my teeth?
  - text: "Bad breath (also known as Halitosis) can be embarrassing and unpleasant for those around you. The most common reasons for bad breath are: decay, gum disease, infection, dry mouth or smoking. Some chronic illnesses can also cause bad breath.\r\n\nTo try to avoid bad breath we recommend that you brush your teeth at least twice a day, remembering to floss in between your teeth to ensure all tooth surfaces are as clean as possible. Keeping yourself hydrated is vitally important so make sure you drink plenty of water and even try chewing sugarless gum. \r\n\nIf the bad breath continues, we suggest that you come in for a chat with Dr Sam and he can help you track down the reason for the problem. With a professional clean and a comprehensive examination, he can then determine if it is a tooth or gum issue and advise you what your next steps are. He can teach you correct cleaning techniques so that you can continue your care at home and hopefully avoid similar situations/conditions in the future.  When necessary Dr Sam can refer you to a medical provider to follow up health concerns."

      Firstly we will need to determine the reason for the staining; is it
      external or internal staining


      * If the staining **external** (Extrinsic) it can be caused by smoking or
      by drinking tea, coffee or red wine. Depending on the cause and the depth
      of the staining, Dr Sam may be able to simply give your teeth a scale and
      polish to bring them back to an acceptable shade and sometimes we need to
      adjust and polish older stained fillings to complete the process. If we
      find this doesn't give you a bright enough smile Dr Sam will suggest a
      teeth whitening (bleaching) treatment. 

      * If the staining is **internal **(Intrinsic) it is often caused by old,
      leaky, metal/amalgam fillings, previously root-treated teeth, and other
      genetic conditions. Dr Sam would suggest that you replace the old metal
      fillings with white tooth coloured resin fillings. Sometimes the best
      solution to mask the underlying stain is to place a dental crown or
      veneer.

      Thankfully the old days of root canal therapy being painful is long gone!
      Nowadays we have instruments and equipment that make the process not only
      easier and faster but also virtually painless! Sometimes after the
      treatment patients can experience a slight discomfort but usually taking a
      couple of mild pain killer will alleviate this.
    title: Does root canal therapy hurt?
  - text: "We want children to feel that going to the dentist is just a part of their everyday life and to have them avoid the fear that some adults experience when going to the dentist. Bring them with you when you come in for your treatment, or when an older brother or sister come in. We can give them a ride in the chair and make the entire experience a fun one. We never push treatment on to a child, we take things nice and easy. At Passion Family Dental we recommend that children first visit a dentist when their baby teeth start to come through. This should be before their second birthday.\r\n\n\r\n\nRemember that even if your baby’s teeth are yet to come through, you can still care for their oral health by wiping their gums with a clean, wet cloth; this will make it easier for when their teeth do erupt as they will be used to having something cleaning their gums."
    title: When should my child first visit the dentist?
  - text: >-
      We recommend that you floss your teeth at least once a day. If you find it
      difficult to floss Dr Sam is more than happy to show you how, he can also
      show you some dental products that will make it nice and easy for you.
      Flossing helps to remove the build-up of plaque from between your teeth
      and along the gum line, where your toothbrush can’t reach.


      Remember - you only need to floss the teeth you want to keep!
    title: How often should I floss my teeth?
  - text: "* Do you experience pain or stiffness in your jaw or temple when you first wake up? \r\n* Maybe your partner has told you that you make grinding sounds with your teeth while you are asleep. \r\n* Are you aware of clenching your jaw when you are angry, anxious or concentrating? \r\n* Are your teeth sensitive and do you experience regular headache, jaw joint or ear pain?\r\n* Have you noticed your teeth are getting wobbly or that you have chipped the enamel off your teeth?\r\n* Do you have raised tissue on the inside of your cheeks cause by cheek biting?\r\n\nIf you answered “yes” to some of these then chances are that you are a tooth grinder! Tooth grinding, or Bruxism, can have several causes such as: emotional stress and anxiety, mental concentration, nutritional deficiency or dehydration, incorrect tooth alignment etc.  \r\n\nIf you are experiencing any of the above symptoms and think that you maybe grinding your teeth, we suggest that you come in and see us at Passion Family Dental as soon as possible. Dr Sam will carry out a comprehensive examination of your teeth and will possibly take x-rays to check how severe the problem is and how much damage has been done to the teeth and supportive bone.  He may suggest some therapy to help assist in the removal or the reduction of the habit and may advise you to wear a night guard (splint) to help alleviate the problem"
    title: Do you grind your teeth?
  - text: "Anyone, young or old, who plays contact sport needs to wear a mouthguard both during competition and in training sessions. Dental injuries can be very painful and sometimes quite expensive and having your child wear a mouthguard can help them avoid potentially a lifetime of dental treatment and expenses.  \r\n\nMouthguards are made and designed to absorb the shock of a hit to the jaw and to protect the teeth and soft tissue. Loose fitting, over the counter mouthguards can be uncomfortable to wear and can easily be dislodged just when they are needed the most. The custom made mouthguards that we provide our patients at Passion Family Dental offer more protection, more coverage and fit more securely, ensuring more comfortable wear."

      Bleeding gums can be an indication of gum disease and cannot be ignored.
      Usually people think they need to stop or reduce brushing or flossing
      their teeth when they notice bleeding but in fact they need to do the
      exact opposite! 


      One of the biggest causes of bleeding gums is the build up of plaque along
      the gumline. Plaque that is not removed by correct brushing and flossing
      techniques hardens into tartar and can irritate the gums, this will then
      cause gums to bleed and can progress into more advanced forms of gum
      disease such as gingivitis. the best way to reduce plaque to to increase
      your oral care routine. 


      Make sure you are using a soft toothbrush as sometimes hard toothbrushes
      are too abrasive and may damage your teeth in the long term. 


      Other contributing factors may be your diet or medication. Foods that
      contain lots of sugar or simple carbohydrates increase your risk for tooth
      and gum problems, as sugar creates an ideal environment for plaque to
      form.  Some over the counter medication, such as aspirin, may thin the
      blood and can therefore increase bleeding. It is also possible that
      prescription medication can cause bleeding gums. If you think it might be
      your medication please speak with your doctor and he/she make change your
      dose or suggest a different medication.


      If you find that the bleeding continues make an appointment to come in and
      speak with Dr Sam so he can examine your teeth to determine if you have a
      more serious condition such as advanced gum disease. More adults lose
      teeth due to gum disease than decay so please don't delay making this
      appointment.
