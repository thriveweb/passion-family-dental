      Passion Family Dental North Lakes is proud to provide Medicare's Child
      Dental Benefit Schedule and bulk bills all services that are available
      through the schedule. The schedule has been developed by Medicare to
      provide dental services for children aged between 2 and 17 years. It
      enables eligible children to receive up to $1000 in dental services over a
      two year period and covers a range of dental services including
      examinations, x-rays, cleaning, fissure sealing, fillings, root canal
      treatments and extractions. Orthodontic or cosmetic treatment is not
      covered by this scheme. The CDBS has a means test, which requires receipt
      of Family Tax Benefit Part A or a relevant Australian Government payment.

      A crown is essentialy a tooth shaped “cap” that is placed over the top of
      the tooth to restore its strength. The crown completely encases the entire
      visible portion of a tooth that lies at and above the gum line. This is a
      great option for teeth that have been weakened through decay or fillings
