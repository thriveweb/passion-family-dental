      Passion Family Dental North Lakes is proud to provide Medicare's Child
      Dental Benefit Schedule and bulk bills all services that are available
      through the schedule. The schedule has been developed by Medicare to
      provide dental services for children aged between 2 and 17 years. It
      enables eligible children to receive up to $1000 in dental services over a
      two year period and covers a range of dental services including
      examinations, x-rays, cleaning, fissure sealing, fillings, root canal
      treatments and extractions. Orthodontic or cosmetic treatment is not
      covered by this scheme. The CDBS has a means test, which requires receipt
      of Family Tax Benefit Part A or a relevant Australian Government payment.

      A crown is essentialy a tooth shaped “cap” that is placed over the top of
      the tooth to restore its strength. The crown completely encases the entire
      visible portion of a tooth that lies at and above the gum line. This is a
      great option for teeth that have been weakened through decay or fillings

      Once we have welcomed you and made sure you are comfortable, we will guide
      you through completing a brief medical history form on our iPad. Once you
      have moved on to the clinic, Dr Andrew Teakle or Dr Nicholas Yee will
      conduct a new patient examination. This involves a thorough review of your
      teeth, gums, chewing muscles, and any lumps or bumps in your mouth.


      We will often take x-rays to discover any decay between your teeth, or old
      leaking fillings that may need replacement. We’ll also take photos with
      our intraoral camera, which we display to you on the chair-side monitor to
      let you see exactly what is going on inside your mouth. Your dentist will
      also give you a thorough explanation of what’s happening with each tooth. 
      At the end of your visit, we give you a treatment plan of findings and
      pricing so you will know exactly what your treatment costs are – no nasty
      surprises!

      As a [Brisbane city dentist](https://www.wickhamterracedental.com.au/),
      there is metered street parking available – you’ll find it’s less
      expensive to park further into the Spring Hill area rather than closer to
      the city. Don’t forget, after 4pm city streets become a ‘clearway’, so
      check the signage when you park.


      We’ve also teamed up with [Astor Terrace Car Park, 28 Astor Tce Spring
      Hill](http://astorterracecarpark.com.au) to offer special discounted
      parking to our patients.


      Park for up to 3 hours for just $15, or stay for up to 5 hours and pay
      only $25! That’s exceptional value for Brisbane CBD parking and it’s just
      100 metres from our practice.


      **For your special rate CBD car parking, just ask us for a parking voucher
      at your next appointment.**


      The train is another easy way to get to Wickham Terrace Dental, as we’re
      located very close to Central train station. There are frequent departures
      and arrivals for all train lines.

    title: Which health funds do you accept?
  - text: >-
      Because we tailor your dental appointment to your personal needs, we can’t
      predict what dental treatment you’ll need in advance. Instead, we’ll
      arrange an initial consultation for our dentist to meet you and your
      teeth.


      For just $259, our new patient special includes a comprehensive dental
      exam, two dental x-rays, and a full professional scale and polish. If you
      are coming in for an emergency dental appointment, our costs start at $96.
      These quoted prices are prior to any health fund rebates.


      If you have private health insurance, depending on your health fund rules,
      you may be entitled to rebates that cover most or all of the cost of two
      exams and cleans per year.

      The Commonwealth Government has introduced the Child Dental Benefits
      Schedule, which provides financial support for basic dental services to
      kids aged between 2 and 17 years.


      The CDBS provides up to $1,000 of benefits per child, over a two calendar
      year period, for examinations, x-rays, cleaning, fissure sealing,

      Invisalign makes unsightly orthodontic treatment a thing of the past.
      Invisalign uses a series of clear, custom fitted aligners to guide your
      teeth back into the ideal position. Each case is individually customised,
      so you may need as few as 20 aligner sets or as many as 35.


      Usually you’ll visit Wickham Terrace Dental every six weeks to receive
      three new sets of aligners, each of which is worn for two weeks. We may
      also ask you to pop in between your six-weekly visits for us to create
      space between your teeth to allow for movement. This is a painless
      procedure which reduces the side of the tooth by half a millimetre or
      less.

      Bad breath (also known as Halitosis) can be embarrassing and unpleasant
      for those around you. The most common reasons for bad breath are:


      **Bacteria and gum disease** In 85-90% of cases, bad breath is caused by a
      build-up of bacteria that produce foul-smelling residue. Our mouth, with
      its moist, warm climate and regular influx of food, is a paradise for
      microorganisms. While good tooth brushing and flossing can clean most
      bacteria away, people with gum disease will have bacteria settle in the
      pockets between the gums and teeth where your toothbrush can’t reach.


      **Dehydration** Lack of water consumption results in a dry mouth and an
      underproduction of saliva, your mouth’s natural cleaning mechanism. This
      allows the bacterial wastes to become more concentrated and stronger
      smelling.


      **Underlying cause** Some more unusual causes of bad breath include
      acid/stomach reflux, oral fungal infections, diabetes, tonsillitis, nasal
      congestion, sinusitis, bronchitis and lung infections, and kidney and
      liver problems.
    title: Why do I have bad breath?
  - text: >-
      **Good oral hygiene** Clean your mouth thoroughly and regularly, focusing
      on brushing between your teeth and especially your back molars. However,
      brushing your teeth is not enough. Your tongue, unfortunately, is like a
      shaggy carpet where all kinds of bacteria can hide. So use your toothbrush
      or a tongue cleaner to “scrape” your tongue and remove bacteria.


      **Floss** Flossing is essential for removing the build-up of bacteria in
      those hard-to-reach spots between your teeth and along the gum line. So
      make flossing as much of an automatic habit as brushing your teeth.


      **Mouthwash** Mouthwash helps to keep your mouth moist, prevent build up
      of plaque, and ultimately prevent bad breath.


      **Sugar free gum** Chewing sugar free gum for 20 minutes after a meal can
      help increase saliva flow. Gum that is 100% xylitol-sweetened can help
      reduce cavities while giving you cool and fresh breath.


      **Visit Wickham Terrace Dental regularly** The more dental plaque you
      have, the more at risk you are of bad breath. So make sure you visit your
      dentist twice a year to keep those bacteria to a minimum. And remember
      that denture cleanliness is just as important as tooth cleanliness for
      controlling halitosis-causing bacteria.
    title: So how can I prevent bad breath?

      **Extrinsic (external) stains** can be caused by smoking, drinking coffee
      or tea, or red wine. Depending on the cause, the solution can be as easy
      as:


      * A scale and polish to remove unsightly marks

      * An adjustment and polish of stained filling edges

      * [Teeth whitening
      treatment](https://wickhamterracedental.com.au/cosmetic-dentist/teeth-whitening-dentist-brisbane-city/)


      **Intrinsic (internal) stains** may be caused by old, leaky, metal amalgam
      fillings, previously root-treated teeth, and other genetic conditions.
      You’ll need to consult Wickham Terrace Dental for a solution to your
      specific intrinsic stain, but common methods of removal include:


      * Replacing old metal amalgam fillings with [white
      fillings](https://www.wickhamterracedental.com.au/general-dentist-brisbane-city/white-tooth-coloured-fillings-dentist-brisbane/)
      (tooth-coloured resin fillings)

      * Internal whitening of previously root-treated teeth

      * [Dental
      crowns](https://www.wickhamterracedental.com.au/restorative-dentist-brisbane-cbd/tooth-crowns-dentist-brisbane/)
      and [dental
      veneers](https://www.wickhamterracedental.com.au/cosmetic-dentist/porcelain-veneers-dentist-brisbane-cbd/)
      to mask underlying stains

      Contrary to popular belief,[ root canal
      therapy](https://www.wickhamterracedental.com.au/restorative-dentist-brisbane-cbd/root-canal-treatment-brisbane-city/)
      (or endodontic treatment) is no more uncomfortable than getting a regular
      filling. In fact, with local anaesthetic your treatment should be
      virtually pain-free.


      The good news is that gentle root canal treatment by Dr Teakle, in the
      comfort of our Brisbane city dental practice, can actively save your tooth
      from extraction.
    title: Does root canal therapy hurt?

      At Wickham Terrace Dental we recommend that children first visit our
      [Brisbane city dentists](https://www.wickhamterracedental.com.au/) when
      their baby teeth start to come through. This should be before their second
      birthday. Even if your baby’s teeth are yet to come through, you can still
      care for their oral health by wiping their gums with a clean, wet cloth.

      Dental implants have revolutionised the way we can treat tooth loss.
      Perfectly emulating the performance of your missing tooth root, [dental
      implants](https://www.wickhamterracedental.com.au/restorative-dentist-brisbane-cbd/dental-implants-dentist-brisbane-city/)
      are made from titanium to be highly biocompatible with your jaw bone.
      Dental implants are surgically inserted into your jaw bone, and over a
      period of months are fully accepted as part of your biological make-up.
      They then form a permanently solid foundation for prosthetic tooth
      replacements such as [dental
      crowns](https://www.wickhamterracedental.com.au/restorative-dentist-brisbane-cbd/tooth-crowns-dentist-brisbane/).

      Your teeth should be flossed every single day. Remember you don’t have to
      floss all of your teeth – just the ones you want to keep! Flossing can
      remove the build-up of plaque from between your teeth and along the gum
      line, where your toothbrush can’t reach.
