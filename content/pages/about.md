      Melody started dental nursing in 1984 and has seen many changes in the
      dental industry over the years. Married for over thirty years and with two
      adult children, Melody brings warmth, compassion and understanding to her
      role.

      Melody understands that most people are nervous when it comes to visiting
      the dentist and takes the time to ensure patients are comfortable and
      relaxed throughout their treatment. Her goal is to have every patient who
      comes to Passion Family Dental North Lakes leave the practice with not
      only a beautiful smile but also looking forward to their next visit.
