    Bleeding gums can be an indication of gum disease and cannot be ignored.
    Usually people think they need to stop or reduce brushing or flossing their
    teeth when they notice bleeding but in fact they need to do the exact
    opposite! One of the biggest causes of bleeding gums is the build up of
    plaque along the gumline. Plaque that is not removed by correct brushing and
    flossing techniques hardens into tartar and can irritate the gums, this will
    then cause gums to bleed and can progress into more advanced forms of gum
    disease such as gingivitis. The best way to reduce plaque to to increase
    your oral care routine. Make sure you are using a soft toothbrush as
    sometimes hard toothbrushes are too abrasive and may damage your teeth in
    the long term. Other contributing factors may be your diet or medication.
    Foods that contain lots of sugar or simple carbohydrates increase your risk
    for tooth and gum problems, as sugar creates an ideal environment for plaque
    to form.  Some over the counter medication, such as aspirin, may thin the
    blood and can therefore increase bleeding. It is also possible that
    prescription medication can cause bleeding gums. If you think it might be
    your medication please speak with your doctor and he/she make change your
    dose or suggest a different medication.If you find that the bleeding
    continues make an appointment to come in and speak with Dr Sam so he can
    examine your teeth to determine if you have a more serious condition such as
    advanced gum disease. More adults lose teeth due to gum disease than decay
    so please don't delay making this appointment.
