      On your first visit to Passion Family Dental North Lakes we will address
      your immediate concerns without pressure for further treatment. We will
      focus on the area of concern and discuss options to treat your immediate
      problem.

      As part of your initial check-up, we recommend 2 standard x-rays to check
      in between your teeth. This allow us to complete a thorough check in
      between your teeth and under any old fillings or crowns that could
      possibly have decay underneath them.

      If any issues are identified, we will explain your condition and advise
      the best course of treatment. We will also suggest ways you can avoid
      similar problems in the future. Our team will then personalise a treatment
      plan that suits your budget and personal dental goals.

      We will contact you by phone or SMS the business day prior to your
      appointment. If you receive an SMS reminder, we ask that you respond to
      the message to secure your appointment time. We understand it is not
      always possible to keep your agreed appointment time and appreciate as
      much notice as possible should you need to reschedule.

      Claiming your health fund rebate is fast and efficient with HICAPS
      automatic claiming. If you have private health insurance with extras
      cover, we can process your claim after your treatment is provided and you
      only have to pay the gap. Make sure you bring your health fund card to
      your appointment as we need it to process your claim.

      In the event we are unable to accommodate your desired appointment time,
      our receptionist will offer to add your to our standby list. Our standby
      list ensures you will be offered your preferred appointment time should it
      become available. Our receptionist will ask your preferences for day and
      time and also check how much notice you require. This way we will not
      bother you unless the appointment is likely to be suitable.
