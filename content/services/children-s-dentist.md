      Medicare’s Child Dental Benefits Schedule gives eligible children aged
      between 2 and 17 access to benefits for basic dental services with the
      total benefit capped at $1,000 per child over a two calendar year period.
      The CDBS has a means test, which requires receipt of Family Tax Benefit
      Part A or a relevant Australian Government payment.


      The Child Dental Benefit Schedule provides benefits for a wide range of
      services including examinations, fillings, cleaning, x-rays, fissure
      sealing, root canals and extractions. Unfortunately benefits are not
      available cosmetic dental, orthodontics or any paid services provided in
      hospital.

      A custom made mouthguard is suitable for anyone who plays a contact sport,
      or sport where there is risk of accidental injury to your mouth. Damage
      from dental injuries can often require lifelong dental treatment to try
      and save the damaged tooth/teeth. Custom made mouthguards offer more
      protection as they offer more coverage and fit securely than generic
      mouthguards.


      Passion Family Dental is able to provide custom made mouthguards for your
      child to wear your  while training and playing games. Ask our receptionist
      about our range of options.
