      Medicare’s Child Dental Benefits Schedule provides access to benefits for
      basic dental services to children aged 2-17 years. The total benefit
      entitlement is capped at $1,000 per child over a two calendar year period.
      The CDBS has a means test, which requires receipt of Family Tax Benefit
      Part A or a relevant Australian Government payment.


      The Child Dental Benefit Schedule provides individual benefits for a range
      of services including examinations, x-rays, cleaning, fissure sealing,
      fillings, root canals and extractions. Benefits are not available for
      orthodontic or cosmetic dental work and cannot be paid for any services
      provided in a hospital.
