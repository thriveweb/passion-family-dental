      A crown is a tooth shaped “cap” that is placed over a tooth to restore its
      strength, shape and size. Crowns are a great option when the strength and
      life span of the tooth is compromised, In some case crons are also used to
      aesthetically improve your smile. When the crown is cemented into place it
      completely encases the visible portion of a tooth above the gum line.


      Dental bridges can greatly improve your ability to chew and are a great
      way to improve your smile by closing any gaps created from missing teeth.
      Both crowns and bridges are very stain resistant and can be made to match
      the look and colour of your natural teeth.
