      Professional tooth whitening can significantly improve your smile. Passion
      Family Dental North Lakes offer a range of whitening systems to make your
      smile your best asset. We will carefully consider any existing dental work
      you currently have, as fillings and crowns will not change colour and
      advise if this option will work for you.

      If you have chipped, discoloured or slightly crooked teeth or would like
      to close small gaps between your teeth, dental veneers are an excellent
      choice. Veneers can be made from porcelain or composite resin. Passion
      Family Dental North Lakes can assess your budget and advise the best
      option for you.

      A crown is a tooth shaped “cap” that is placed over a tooth to restore its
      strength, shape and size. Crowns are a great option when the strength and
      life span of the tooth is compromised, but in some cases are used to
      improve aesthetics. When the crown is cemented into place it completely
      encases the entire visible portion of a tooth that lies at and above the
      gum line. 


      Dental bridges can close a gap where a tooth is missing and can improve
      your smile and chewing function. Crowns and bridges can be made to match
      the look and colour of your natural teeth. They are very resistant to
      staining and will not discolour over time like natural teeth.

      If you have crowded teeth often the best way to improve your smile is to
      have your teeth straightened. If you are interested in straightening your
      teeth our dentists will refer you to a specialist for orthodontic
      treatment.
