      We recommend that you come in for a check up and clean every 6 months to
      help detect any signs of early decay and avoid any other oral health
      problems in the future.
    title: Check up and clean
  - content: >-
      A daily routine of brushing morning and night, flossing, together with
      good oral hygiene practice and regular dental check-ups, should help
      prevent the need for fillings and any further restorations in the future.
      This also decreases the risk of developing gum disease and other dental
      problems, and ensures a healthy mouth and smile.
