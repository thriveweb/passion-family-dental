      Removing a tooth is our last resort as your teeth are much stronger and
      more efficient for biting and chewing than an artificial replacement is.
      In the event that you may need a tooth removed our experienced and gentle
      team will ensure your procedure is pain free and that you are comfortable
      every step of the way.

      Wisdom teeth commonly start coming through between the age of 16 and 25.
      Without enough space in your jaw your wisdom teeth are at risk of becoming
      impacted. Impacted teeth can become infected and/or damage the tooth in
      front. 


      Before we undertake any surgical procedure we'll discuss what's involved
      and any risks you should be aware of. In that majority of cases, wisdom
      teeth can be removed safely at our North Lakes dental practice. However,
      if your wisdom teeth are in a complex position we may  recommend you to a
      specialist for a second opinion and management.
