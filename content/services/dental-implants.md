  Dental implants can be used to replace a missing tooth, or to secure your
  denture. 
shortDescription: >-
  Dental implants are a replacement of the root of the tooth, which provides a
  strong foundation for a crown (cap) to be placed, to replicate the look and
  function of a natural tooth. Whether you want to replace a missing tooth, or
  would like to secure your denture with a dental implant, speak with one of our
  friendly staff about your options.
