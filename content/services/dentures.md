      There are two types of dentures, complete and partial. Complete dentures
      are made when there are no natural teeth remaining. Partial dentures are
      made when there are natural teeth remaining. Dentures can vary greatly in
      design, processing time and cost so it is always best to have a discussion
      directly with your dentist to find out exactly what your options are. Your
      dentist will discuss the best option for you explaining the advantages and
      disadvantages of each.

      For straight forward cases, making your denture involves:


      * taking initial impressions of your teeth and jaw;

      * from these impressions we will create working models and construct
      custom tray;

      * the custom tray is then used to take a more accurate impression of your
      teeth;

      * the dentist will also take a registration of your bite to ensure you
      denture functions well;

      * teeth will then be set in wax so that you can see if you are happy with
      the appearance, shape and colour;

      * Once you and the dentist are happy, your denture will be made using
      permanent materials;

      * Your finished denture will be fitted and adjusted so it is comfortable;

      * After one week we like to see you again to check the fit of your denture
      again.


      Making your denture may require more or less appointments depending on
      your unique situation.
