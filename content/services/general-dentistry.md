      Tooth decay, if left untreated, leads to the development of holes in the
      teeth, more commonly known as cavities. Cavities are often the result of
      poor dietary choices and oral hygiene practices. It is important to
      maintain regular checkups so that we can find and stop decay before it
      reaches the nerve of the tooth. We will restore the tooth by removing the
      decay and replacing it with a dental filling. If left untreated, decay may
      reach the nerve, meaning that a root canal would be needed to save the
      tooth.

      At Passion Family Dental North Lakes we only use composite fillings which
      are white or  "tooth coloured". Technology for tooth coloured fillings has
      improved meaning your filings last longer and look great. We can also
      replace any old ugly amalgam fillings that may have cracked or decayed,
      with a new tooth coloured filling.
