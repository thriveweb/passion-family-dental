      Tooth decay, if left untreated, leads to the development of holes in the
      teeth, more commonly known as cavities. Cavities are often the result of
      poor dietary choices and oral hygiene practices. It is important to
      maintain regular checkups so that we can find and stop and decay before it
      reaches the nerve of the tooth. We will a restore the tooth by removing
      the decay and replacing it with a dental filling. If left untreated, decay
      may reach the nerve, meaning that a root canal would be needed to save the
      tooth.
